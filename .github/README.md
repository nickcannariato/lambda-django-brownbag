# Django Brownbag

Hey there! This is a repository of example code that corresponds to a brownbag talk I gave at @LambdaSchool about Django.

If you're a Lambda School student, great! You're in the right place. You can feel free to clone this repository and poke around. There's a lot here and the rest of this README will provide you resources to help you Grok what's going on.

If you're basically anyone else, this code is for education purposes and meant to provide a quick run through on [Django](https://wwwdjangoproject.com) and [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). I'd recomend going through the official docs and some of the resources listed here if you're trying to learn either of those frameworks/tools.

## Official Docs
